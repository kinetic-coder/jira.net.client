# Purpose
I have worked with Jira for quite a while and really like it. As a Team Leader there are some activities I find challenging either because I cannot get the information out in the format I would like or I cannot do batch updates.

I am a professional .NET developer specialising in C# so i wanted a .NET libray that utilised Jira's Rest API to ooen up the possibilities.
